Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data. 
There are three main types of ML: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Common algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled outputs. Clustering algorithms such as k-means and DBSCAN are common examples.

Reinforcement learning involves agents learning through rewards and penalties, often used in robotics and game AI.
