Text processing is crucial in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Steps include:
1. Tokenization – Splitting text into words or sentences.
2. Stopword Removal – Removing common words like 'the', 'and', 'is'.
3. Stemming/Lemmatization – Reducing words to their base form.
4. Vectorization – Converting text into numerical representations using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

ML.NET provides text transformation APIs like FeaturizeText() to process text efficiently.
